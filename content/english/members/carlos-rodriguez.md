I am a software engineering student focused on backend development and cloud infrastructure. I love working with distributed systems and have experience with microservices architecture.

My technical stack includes Python, Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes, and various cloud platforms. I'm always interested in learning about new technologies that can improve system reliability and performance.
