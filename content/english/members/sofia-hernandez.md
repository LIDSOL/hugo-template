I am a computer science student with a focus on mobile application development and data analysis. I love creating mobile apps that solve real-world problems and make use of data insights.

My technical expertise includes Flutter, React Native, Python for data analysis, and machine learning frameworks. I'm particularly interested in applications that combine mobile technology with data science to create meaningful user experiences.
