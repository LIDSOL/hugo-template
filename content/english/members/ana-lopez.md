I am a professor at the Faculty of Engineering, UNAM, with over 10 years of experience in software engineering and open source research. I lead academic initiatives and mentor students in their research projects.

My research interests include software engineering methodologies, open source development practices, and educational technology. I supervise thesis projects and coordinate workshops and conferences related to free and open source software.
