I am a systems engineering student passionate about DevOps practices and infrastructure automation. I enjoy setting up CI/CD pipelines and monitoring systems that help teams deploy software more efficiently.

My experience includes working with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Prometheus, and various cloud platforms. I'm particularly interested in infrastructure as code and automated testing practices.
