I am a computer engineering student with a passion for frontend development and user experience design. I enjoy creating intuitive and accessible web interfaces that make technology more approachable for everyone.

My main areas of expertise include React, Vue.js, and modern CSS frameworks. I also have experience in accessibility testing and user research.
